Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea:

I want to create a text mode classic Tetris game using Golang and console. The rules are classic:
- Glass 20x10 cell
- Standard piece set


Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.

Certainly! Before compiling the full specification, I want to confirm a few key details to ensure completeness:

1. Game Loop & Rendering: How should the game update and render in the console? Do you want to use a fixed-time step loop or frame skipping for better responsiveness?
2. User Input Handling: How should player input be captured in the terminal (e.g., arrow keys for movement, space for a hard drop)? Should it be handled asynchronously?
3. Piece Rotation System: Should we use the Super Rotation System (SRS) or a simpler rotation method?
Collision Detection & Movement Constraints: Should we follow classic Tetris rules for piece movement, such as wall kicks and lock delay?
4. Scoring & Level Progression: Should the game implement a scoring system (e.g., based on Tetris guidelines)? How should levels progress?
5. Game Over Condition: Is it standard (when a piece locks above the playfield)?
6. Persistence & Configurability: Should the game save high scores, user settings, or other data? How configurable should parameters like speed, gravity, or controls be?
7. Testing & Debugging Tools: Would you like a debug mode or logging for easier testing?
8. Deployment & Dependencies: Should this be a standalone Go binary without dependencies, or can we use external libraries (e.g., for input handling or rendering)?
9. Error Handling & Resilience: How robust should the game be in handling unexpected inputs or crashes?


Once you confirm these details, I’ll compile a thorough developer-ready specification based on our discussion.

1) Fixed time step
2) Arrow keys for movement, space for hard drop, arrow up rotate piece, arrow down faster moving down (but not drop))
3) Implement both but it should be defined by a bool flag,  default simple
4) Explain please
5) yes and yes
6) Yeah 
7) Yeah
8) Add tests as much as possible (unit tests should be perfect)
9) Standalone Gol binary, you can use extenral libs for easier terminal output (typso are fine :)

Ask me extra questions if something is still unclear or need some clarification.

By following this specification, a Go developer should be able to implement a classic Tetris game that runs in the console with smooth gameplay, accurate Tetris mechanics, and a robust structure. The focus is on clarity, maintainability, and an authentic Tetris feel, while also providing enough flexibility (via configuration and debug modes) to extend or tweak the game in the future.
